    <p>My favorite dish is iskender. İskender kebap is a Turkish dish that consists of sliced döner kebab meat topped with hot tomato sauce over pieces of pita bread and generously slathered with melted special sheep's milk butter and yogurt. It can be prepared from thinly cut grilled lamb or chicken. The prepared doner kebab is placed in front of the burning fire at a distance of 10-15 cm from the previously lit doner kebab fire. The doner kebab is cooked slowly over this fire, and after it is cooked, it is cut thinly with a knife from top to bottom. Thus, the doner kebab is ready for service. Tomato sauce and melted butter are generally poured over the dish live at the table for the customer's amusement.</p>

    <p>It is one of the most popular dishes in Turkey. It takes its name from its inventor, İskender Efendi, who lived in Bursa in the late 19th century Ottoman Empire.</p>

    <p>"Kebapçı İskender" is trademarked by the İskenderoğlu family, who still run the restaurant in Bursa. This dish is available in many restaurants throughout the country, mostly under the name "İskender kebap,"  "Bursa kebabı,"  or at times with an alternative one made up by the serving restaurant, such as "Uludağ kebabı.".</p>

    <p>The main reason I like iskender is that I love Doner, and my dad also loves Doner. We usually go out once a week to eat doner; it's like a tradition for us. We always make jokes about getting a kilo doner and eating it.</p>
